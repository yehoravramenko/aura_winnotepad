# Windows Notepad by Aura

*It is a simple notepad application which is not supposed to bring something revolutionary new, yet it just replicates original MS Windows Notepad functionality and being an open-source program.*

The core idea of this project is to recreate one of default apps by Microsoft for Windows in pure C which runs flawlessly, with no modern bloat and too high-level code and, of course, keep it absolutely open-source.
